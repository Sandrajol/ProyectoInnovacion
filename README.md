## Project Description

This project focuses on developing a soft sensor powered by artificial intelligence to estimate penicillin concentration in a simulated bioreactor. Using data from the IndPenSim environment, various machine learning algorithms are trained and compared based on online-measured variables. The aim is to enhance real-time monitoring and control in biotechnological production processes.

## Getting Started

Instructions for contributors

1. Clone this repo (for help see this [tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)).
2. Raw Data is being kept [here](Repo folder containing raw data) within this repo.

   _If using offline data mention that and how contributors may obtain the data )_

3. Data processing/transformation scripts are being kept [here](Repo folder containing data processing scripts/notebooks)
4. etc...

_If your project is well underway and setup is fairly complicated (ie. requires installation of many packages) create another "setup.md" file and link to it here_

5. Follow setup [instructions](Link to file)
